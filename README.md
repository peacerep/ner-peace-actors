# Extracting Named Actors from Text: Using Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Peace and Conflict Studies - Demonstration
This repository contains 2 Jupyter notebooks to enable users to run spaCy's NER model to identify, extract and categorise named entities from text, and matching these recognised entities with the actor data PeaceRep have collected for the Peace Agreement Actor Dataset (PAA-X) (Badanjak and Henry, 2023) - an extension to the [PA-X Peace Agreements Database]([url](https://www.peaceagreements.org/)https://www.peaceagreements.org/).
